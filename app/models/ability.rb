# Please do not define permissions using blocks. Use the hash notation.
# Using blocks breaks load_and_authorize_resource unless you define the SQL query as well.
# See: https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/Defining-Abilities and the separate pages for the different kinds of definitions.

# When you add a permission, please add a test for it, even if it is obvious what it does.
